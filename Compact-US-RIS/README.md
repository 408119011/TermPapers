# Compact User-Specific RIS for Uplink Transmission

- Uplink transmission by Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with multilayer concept have reduced the size, cost and power constraints at the user side for large scale antenna array requirement in next-generation wireless communications.
- Multi-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new degree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially exploited for performance enhancement.
