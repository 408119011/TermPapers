# Intelligent Reflecting Surface vs Decode-and-Forword

- Compared IRS (Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces) with DF (Decode and Forward) relaying in terms of minimum transmit power requirements and maximum energy efficiency.
- Computed minimum number elements (Nmin) required in IRS to beat DF for achieving higher data rate than DF.
- After assuming ideal scenario for IRS, obtained Nmin = 164 for rate = 4 bits/sec/Hz and Nmin = 74 for rate = 6 bits/sec/Hz.
