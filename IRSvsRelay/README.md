# Intelligent Reflecting Surface vs Decode-and-Forword

- Compared IRS (Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces) with DF (Decode and Forward) relaying in terms of minimum transmit power requirements and maximum energy efficiency.
- Computed minimum number elements (N<sub>min</sub>) required in IRS to beat DF for achieving higher data rate than DF.
- After assuming ideal scenario for IRS, obtained N<sub>min</sub> = 164 for rate = 4 bits/sec/Hz and N<sub>min</sub> = 74 for rate = 6 bits/sec/Hz.
- IRS only achieve higher energy efficiency than DF when very high rates are needed.
